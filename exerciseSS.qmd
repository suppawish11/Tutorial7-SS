# Introduction
This is a introduction


This proposal report is created for Kogan, Australian’s consumer electronic brand that provide wide range of products with aggressive pricing, which they are planning for an opportunity to expand their products to the new market in different country. The chosen country that is recommended for Kogan to expand to is Indonesia with the potential customer based on the large population size in the country. The suited entry strategy for Kogan to utilize is the direct export to the chosen market destination to test the market and the brand ability to gain new customer based and viability for future expansion in the chosen market with almost minimal of investment to entry the market compared to other strategy. Kogan has several points of difference from their marketing strategy that they used and the points of parity as a requirement that they should meet for the purpose of competing in the market and attracting the customers. It is suggested that Kogan should target the customer in the Indonesia’s market who have medium to low-income range as Kogan should deliver the same customer value that they offer in Australia which is mainly affordability product and convenient. 

Brand/Company Introduction
Kogan is Australia's Consumer Electronics and Appliances Brand. Kogan is known for their incredible prices on a wide range of electronic products from LED TVs, Phones, Heaters, Air Conditioners, Kitchen Appliances and much more. Kogan had entered the Australian market since 2006 and as an electronic retailer then decided to have their own electronic brand that in the competitive lower price range for mostly every consumer electronic product range (Kogan Australia, 2019).

By conducting SWOT analysis for internal and external, it shows that Kogan has several strengths from the experience and their pricing strategy but there is also weaknesses from the product quality, channel of distribution and the present of product to the market that Kogan should be aware of. Externally, the opportunities from the potential growth of e-commerce in the market and the government that aim to increase the medium-income people from the low-income, which these will be the opportunity to support Kogan’s growth in the market. However, the intensity of the market from the existing brands in the market is very high and the cultural difference of Australia and Indonesia could make some impact toward the effectiveness of Kogan’s marketing strategy if Kogan company had expand their market globally to the United Kingdom by exporting their brand to the UK market but their still operated in Australia
